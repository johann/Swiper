# Swiper

Swiper is the current app used by St John's University Queens Campus to capture student data from identification cards (StormCards). This data is used to provide the university with the ability to track student attendance during events on campus so that they can analyse that student data, contact individual students and assess the success of programs. Swiper was originally written to provide a backup system when wifi across campus was unavailable but is now the main app used by the university. 

Data from a student's stormcard is stored on the device via core data. As a backup system each record is pushed to Parse. After a student worker has "swiped" an event, they can hit the "Email" button which retrieves all the card data in the database and compiles it into an email which is sent to the required administrators. 

Swiper requires the device it is installed on to be equiped with the [Linea Pro 5](http://ipcprint.com/ios-peripherals/linea-pro-5.html). The Linea Pro is a case that fits around the device allowing magnetic cards to be swiped.
